# cnn-image classification

## Description

This repository features a Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras for classifying cat and dog images. The model architecture includes two convolutional layers with 32 filters of size 3x3 and ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling layers for downsampling. Finally, two dense layers, the first with 64 neurons and the second, output layer, with a sigmoid activation, handle classification into cat or dog categories.
